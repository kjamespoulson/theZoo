# theZoo

    The Zoo app, written in JavaScript using Handlebars.js and CSS, allows a zoo employees to track their animals'
    feeding schedules. Data regarding these animals is stored in a MySQL database and the queries for it are 
    generated dynamically from user input. This application was created in collaboration with my partner Justice, 
    and was hosted on the Oregon State University's web servers.
